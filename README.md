# Teler OpenAI Bridge

A reference integration between Teler and OpenAI Realtime API, based on Media Streaming over WebSockets. This project bridges Teler (telephony calls) with OpenAI Realtime API for live two-way conversational agents.

It handles:

Incoming audio from Teler (8kHz PCM16)

Upsampling to 24kHz for OpenAI

Sending audio chunks via WebSocket

Receiving AI-generated audio (24kHz PCM16)

Downsampling back to 8kHz for Teler

Streaming transcripts and responses in real-time

ðŸ“ž Flow

Teler connects â†’ streams 8kHz PCM audio chunks.

App upsamples to 24kHz â†’ sends to OpenAI Realtime API.

OpenAI generates response audio (24kHz PCM16).

App downsamples to 8kHz â†’ sends back to Teler.

Smooth playback ensured by audio buffering.

ðŸ”„ Call Flow

Teler â†’ Bridge

Receives 8kHz PCM16 audio chunks from the telephony call.

Upsamples to 24kHz.

Sends to OpenAI via WebSocket (input_audio_buffer.append).

Bridge â†’ OpenAI

Handles session creation (session.update).

Forwards audio in real-time.

OpenAI â†’ Bridge

Streams AI-generated audio (response.output_audio.delta).

Buffers chunks for smooth playback.

Downsamples to 8kHz.

Bridge â†’ Teler

Sends audio back into the live call.

Transcripts and AI text logs available in console.
